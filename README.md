# web-boilerplate
Boilerplate with components:

Gulp 4 + Webpack + babel + sass + es6

## This gulps works in node v14+.

### Local development:
- Run `npm install`
- Run `gulp`
- The `index.html` inside the `src` folder, works like a summary. This is the default page that will open when you start the development environment. You can customize it.
- The others folders is just like any other web project structure.

### Open localhost

- When type `gulp` in console, a page with port 3000 will be created if available, to access the page just walk in the directories, example: `http://localhost:3000/dist/html/auth.html`
